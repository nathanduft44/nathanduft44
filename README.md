- 👋 Hi, I’m @nathanduft
- 👀 Dedicated Blockchain and Quantitative Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently building a crypto security solution with a token that I am super passionate about. I recently performed quant on the broad crypto market mainly BTC and ETH with on-chain data and legacy financial metrics. On my off hours I am usually doing crypto research and planning my week ahead.
- 💞️ I love decentralization and open source composable code. This world is reaching a better place through the internet and I am here to help businesses reach new heights and create sick dapps. Send me an email if you have any questions. 
- I am a passionate surfer as well and love to charge 30foot waves.
