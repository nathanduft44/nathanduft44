- 👋 Hi, I’m @nathanduft
- 👀 I’m interested in building web3 applications, algorithmic trading systems, and Quantitative Analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently building a algorithmic trading bot that will be ran on Uniswap V2 via Eth Test Net. The trading algorithim will be mounted with Machine Learning and Technical Analysis conditions. I am seeking a way to reduce risk on the random walk of future price prediction. On the other hand I am looking for arbitrage among centralized and decentralized exchanges. This is all for the purpose of solidifying my machine learning skills, data science, and to better understand the crypto market. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startup projects that are doing cool things in the crypto domain. I am very excited to find a group of individuals with the same match of drive and curiosity for decentralized cloud servicing mechanisms. I want to build the future through web3 peer to peer ownership.
